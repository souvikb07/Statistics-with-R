```{r}

## What's that data type?
Do you remember that when you added 5 + "six", you got an error due to a mismatch in data types? You can avoid such embarrassing situations by checking the data type of a variable beforehand. You can do this with the class() function, as the code on the right shows.

Complete the code in the editor and also print out the classes of my_character and my_logical.
```{r}
# Declare variables of different types
my_numeric <- 42
my_character <- "universe"
my_logical <- FALSE 

# Check class of my_numeric
class(my_numeric)

# Check class of my_character
class(my_character)

# Check class of my_logical
class(my_logical)
```
## Create a vector (2)
Let us focus first!

On your way from rags to riches, you will make extensive use of vectors. Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.

In R, you create a vector with the combine function c(). You place the vector elements separated by a comma between the parentheses. For example:

numeric_vector <- c(1, 2, 3)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")
Once you have created these vectors in R, you can use them to do calculations.
```{r}
numeric_vector <- c(1, 10, 49)
character_vector <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Complete the code for boolean_vector
boolean_vector <-c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
```
## Create a vector (3)
After one week in Las Vegas and still zero Ferraris in your garage, you decide that it is time to start using your data analytical superpowers.

Before doing a first analysis, you decide to first collect all the winnings and losses for the last week:

For poker_vector:

On Monday you won $140
Tuesday you lost $50
Wednesday you won $20
Thursday you lost $120
Friday you won $240
For roulette_vector:

On Monday you lost $24
Tuesday you lost $50
Wednesday you won $100
Thursday you lost $350
Friday you won $10
You only played poker and roulette, since there was a delegation of mediums that occupied the craps tables. To be able to use this data in R, you decide to create the variables poker_vector and roulette_vector.
```{r}
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <-  c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)
```
## Naming a vector
As a data analyst, it is important to have a clear view on the data that you are using. Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential.

In the previous exercise, we created a vector with your winnings over the week. Each vector element refers to a day of the week but it is hard to tell which element belongs to which day. It would be nice if you could show that in the vector itself.

You can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function. Have a look at this example:

some_vector <- c("John Doe", "poker player")
names(some_vector) <- c("Name", "Profession")
This code first creates a vector some_vector and then gives the two elements a name. The first element is assigned the name Name, while the second element is labeled Profession. Printing the contents to the console yields following output:

          Name     Profession 
    "John Doe" "poker player" 
```{r}
# Poker winnings from Monday to Friday
poker_vector <- c(140, -50, 20, -120, 240)

# Roulette winnings from Monday to Friday
roulette_vector <- c(-24, -50, 100, -350, 10)

# Assign days as names of poker_vector
names(poker_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")

# Assign days as names of roulette_vector
names(roulette_vector) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
```
